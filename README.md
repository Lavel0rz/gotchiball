### About Gotchiball

Fun project I made for fun with the assistance of ChatGPT with no prior knowledge of node or javascript, so you can see a lot of errors in my code

## Main To Dos:

* Refactor / Optimize code
* Refactor files ( assets, scripts, server files) 
* Since it's all client based, remake into Authoritative Server Logic
* Multiplayer / Web3 implementation (6 max player rooms 3v3 soccer idea)
* Fix bugs like when you travel with the ball to the goal instead of shooting it you score more than one goal for some reason

# Main Game Controls

* Spacebar to shoot the ball in the angle its facing, if you are colliding with the ball
* Shift to 'boost' yourself with some speed, has a 5 second cooldown
* WASD to move
